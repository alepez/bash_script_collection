# Bash Script Collection

This is a collection of bash script I often use.

### Installation

I suggest to install them in `/usr/local/bin` if you have root access or in
`~/bin` if you do not. If you add these scripts in `~/bin`, you need to add
this directory in your PATH environment variable. To do so, edit your `.bashrc`
(create it if you haven't) and add these line:

    export PATH="${PATH}:~/bin"

Remeber to add exec permission with

    chmod +x /path/to/script
